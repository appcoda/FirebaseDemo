{"name":"Firebasedemo","tagline":"Building a Social Jokes App using Firebase","body":"In this day and age, it is practically impossible to build a fully self-contained app that users will really like. As such, iOS developers are reaching out beyond the tools and resources provided by Apple for access to data and storage. A fantastic option for developers is the backend-as-a-service, or BaaS. \r\n\r\nAmong the best and most popular BaaSs is Google's [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com). Actually, Firebase is positively fantastic in performance, implementation, and upkeep. The key to Firebase's immediate value is its realtime database that stores data in JSON. Any change in the database is immediately synced across all clients, or devices, that use the same database. In other words, Firebase is ridiculously fast; everything is updated instantly.\r\n\r\nFirebase also offers user authentication along with storage, and all data is transferred via a secure SSL connection. For authentication, we can choose from any combination of email and password, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Google, or a custom solution. \r\n\r\nIn addition to iOS, Firebase has SDKs for Android and JavaScript. All platforms can share the same database, and Firebase scales apps automatically. \r\n\r\nFor full tutorials, please refer to http://www.appcoda.com/firebase/.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
